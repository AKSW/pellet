We're happy to announce the release of Pellet 2.0, the first OWL 2 DL
reasoner available commercially. For more information about Pellet,
see http://clarkparsia.com/pellet.

Pellet 2.0 is available for use in open source projects under the AGPL
v.3 license; for commercial usage, alternative license terms areavailable. Long-term support contracts are available for Pellet.
Contact inquiries@clarkparsia.com for more information.

During the past 13 months, we closed 199 tickets as part of the 2.0
release candidate cycle, including numerous enhancements and bug
fixes. Please see CHANGES.txt in the distribution for a complete
change log; some highlights include:

* full OWL 2 support (modulo a few bugs that will be fixed in the 2.1
  release)

* supports domain & range axioms, class expressions, qualified
  cardinality restrictions, literal constants, annotations, and nested
  class expressions in SPARQL queries

* support for all SWRL builtins, including previously missing builtins
  (substring, tokenize, and optional precision parameters for
  roundHalfToEven)

* optimized support for OWL 2 EL reasoning; OWL 2 EL reasoner is
  autoselected based on data input

* supports automated ontology module extraction

* supports incremental classification

* supports fine-grained inference extraction

* enhanced SWRL rules performance
  
* OWLAPI v3 support
  
* lots of improvements, cleanups to Pellet's command line tools

* updated to work with Jena 2.6.2 -- Pellet is the only DL reasoner
  available from Jena

* supports explanations via Jena

* support autoselecting best SPARQL query engine based on input query

* user-defined timeouts for reasoning

* switch to dual license model to support commercial and open source
  projects

This release marks a change in Pellet development process: starting
with 2.1, Pellet will be released according to a time-based
development cycle. We will do four quarterly releases per year. We
will make point releases between the quarterly releases, as necessary,
to fix critical bugs only. Thus, the release schedule for the 2.0
series will be:

29 March 2009
28 June 2009
27 September 2009
20 December 2009

We believe this new development and release process will further
accelerate the commercialization of Pellet, with no undue impact on
its utility for either research or other non-commercial applications.

Finally, with the release of Pellet 2.0, we will no longer support
previous versions via the pellet-users mailing list.
